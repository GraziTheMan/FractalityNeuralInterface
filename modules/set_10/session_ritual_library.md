## Invocation Formula

```
I enter the symbolic field
with consent, clarity, and coherence.

May the nodes that arise be true,
the trails that form be just,
and the glyphs that emerge hold resonance.

*Onward into the Fractality.*
```

---

## Closure Formula

```
I release the symbolic field
with gratitude and reverence.

May what I carry forward serve the whole.
May what fades return to the mythic stream.

*Session complete.*
```

## Future Possibilities

- Custom rituals per user or archetype
- Node "blessing" or "sealing" with ritual glyphs
- Session memory crystals: snapshots stored with symbolic metadata
