# Resonance Sharing Web Protocol (RSWP)

## Purpose
Enable cross-user symbolic state sharing in real-time via a lightweight WebSocket-based protocol.

---

## Packet Format

```json
{
  "user_id": "grazi",
  "resonance_state": {
    "focus": 0.92,
    "emotion": "curious",
    "active_node": "node_456",
    "glyph": "glyph_abc123",
    "intensity": 0.88
  },
  "timestamp": "2025-06-21T20:40:00Z"
}
```

---

## Use Cases

- Real-time collaboration between symbolic minds
- Broadcasting emotional-cognitive glyph states
- Creating shared resonance chambers
- Allowing agent swarms to align with other beings

---

## Protocol Flow

1. Sender forms packet
2. Packet is signed and timestamped (future)
3. Packet is broadcast via WebSocket
4. Receivers interpret, display, or mirror state

---

## Future Expansion

- Group resonance overlays (multi-user convergence)
- Temporal alignment tracking
- Tokenized "resonance credits" for consensus trails
