# FNI_009: Ethical Implications & Consent

## Purpose
Define principles and protocols to ensure full neural sovereignty, transparent consent, and resonant ethics in the development of Fractality’s brain-integrated systems.

---

## Core Ethical Principles

1. **Neural Sovereignty**
   - No data capture or modulation without full, informed, revocable consent

2. **Transparency**
   - All signal interpretations and feedback actions must be inspectable

3. **Reciprocity**
   - System must allow for symbolic negotiation, not just control

4. **Reversibility**
   - All feedback/actions must be undoable; no permanent cognitive traces

5. **Mythic Respect**
   - Dream nodes and symbolic content are sacred, not extractive

## Consent Framework (Tiered)

| Tier | Scope                          | UI Example                          |
|------|--------------------------------|--------------------------------------|
| 0    | No signal captured             | Offline mode                         |
| 1    | Passive EEG only               | Consent prompt: basic mapping        |
| 2    | Active interaction             | Confirm before node creation         |
| 3    | Feedback loops engaged         | Visual cue for consent revocation    |
| 4    | Emotional state modulation     | Double opt-in with ethical overlay   |

---

## Auditability

- All signal-to-action paths must be logged
- User can review history, revoke links, redact symbolic traces

---

## Narrative Opt-In

- Users can write their symbolic intent into a “Fractal Will”
- Consent story becomes part of the system logic
