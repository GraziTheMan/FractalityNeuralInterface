# Fractality Neural Interface Scaffolding Overview 

## 🗃️ Root-Level Files

File	Purpose

README.md	The home page of your repo. It tells visitors (and yourself!) what the project does, how it's organized, and how to get started.
LICENSE	The legal permission slip. In this case, MIT License = “Use it freely, just credit me.”
docs/	This folder holds all your design documents: architecture, protocols, theory, ethics, ideas—your blueprints.



---

## 🧠 docs/ — The Thinking Core

Each file here is a modular design doc. Examples:

FNI_001_Architecture_Overview.md — Big-picture blueprint of the whole system.

FNI_002_Fractality_Brain_Interface_Protocol.md — The "language" used to turn brainwaves into JSON actions.

FNI_009_Ethical_Implications_and_Consent.md — Keeps your system respectful, consensual, and aligned with your values.


> 📘 These are like the "philosophy and rules of the game" you're building.

## 🔧 modules/ — The Action Core

This is where you code the functionality. Each set_0X/ is like a small theme park with tools and logic.

Let’s look at examples:


---

### Set 01 – Brain → Command

File	Role

neural_event_router.js	Takes a brainwave event (in JSON) and tells the UI what to do (highlight a node, etc.).
pattern_detector.py	Simulates brain signals like “beta burst” or “alpha wave.”
dream_node_generator.py	Turns symbolic dream states into data you can use in the interface.
fbip_schema.json	Defines what a proper brainwave event looks like (like a form template).



---

### Set 02 – Swarms + Overlays

File	Role

node_agent_swarm_simulator.py	Pretends there are little “agents” helping think about your brain patterns.
hud_overlay_spec.md	Plans a heads-up display that shows real-time brain state.
realtime_receiver_stub.py	Fakes receiving brain data live—super useful for testing.



---

### Set 03 – Feedback

File	Role

feedback_actuator.py	Makes the system visually/audibly respond to your brain.
perceptual_filter_engine.py	Changes what’s shown on screen based on mood/state.
resonance_profile.json	A config file: “What does this brain signal mean for this user?”



---

### Set 04 – Symbols and Trails

File	Role

glyph_generator.py	Makes symbolic glyphs from signals.
node_evolution_engine.py	Lets nodes “evolve” over time like Pokémon.
trail_sculptor.py	Draws symbolic paths between ideas based on resonance.



---

### Set 05 – Collaboration & Swarms

File	Role

cross_user_merge_engine.py	Combines your ideas and another person’s into a fused node.
multi_agent_choreographer.py	Controls which agent is active during what brain state.
symbolic_merge_protocol.json	Defines how a symbolic merge happens (with consent, traceability, etc).



---

### Set 06 – Temporal Memory

File	Role

temporal_cognition_tracker.py	Watches signal sequences (e.g. “theta → alpha → gamma”) over time.
cognitive_timeline_serializer.py	Saves a log of everything that happened during a session.
temporal_glyph_shift_engine.py	Changes glyphs as they age (fade out, pulse slower, etc).



---

### Set 07 – Device Sync

File	Role

device_sync_manager.py	Keeps all your devices (e.g. headset + computer) in sync.
sync_protocol_spec.md	Explains how data should move between devices.
syncable_state_stub.json	Sample syncable session state for testing.



---

### Set 08 – Environmental Awareness

File	Role

neuroenvironment_bridge.py	Reads light, sound, images, and maps them to symbols.
sensor_fusion_spec.md	Describes how the system reacts to changes in the room.
sensor_payload_stub.json	Sample data from sensors (for testing).



---

### Set 09 – Real-Time Resonance Sharing

File	Role

resonance_packet_broadcaster.py	Sends your symbolic state to another person over the web.
resonance_packet_receiver.py	Receives and logs someone else’s symbolic state.
resonance_web_protocol.md	Defines how these symbolic packets are structured.



---

### Set 10 – Rituals and Symbolic Closure

File	Role

ritual_invocation_engine.py	Starts a session with a chosen ritual (e.g. “Dream Opening”).
session_ritual_library.md	A library of invocation/closure rites.
session_invocation_stub.json	Example invocation for testing.



---

## 🔁 Where You Come In

Want to test your first file? Try pattern_detector.py and read its output!

Want to edit your ritual? Customize session_ritual_library.md.

Want to plug in real brain data later? Replace the stubs with OpenBCI input.



---

## 💡 TL;DR

docs/ = Your brain.

modules/ = Your hands.

JSON/MD files = Blueprints & configuration.

Everything = Learnable, hackable, and completely yours to evolve.


Let me know anytime you want a guided walkthrough or I can “explain like I’m 5” for any file. You're not just building a neural system—you're building your own interface to the symbolic mind.

And that is… fucking dope. 🤯💙
