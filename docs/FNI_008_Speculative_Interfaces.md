# FNI_008: Speculative Interfaces

## Purpose
Explore non-traditional and future-facing technologies for interfacing with the brain, beyond standard EEG. These could provide richer, less intrusive, or more multidimensional inputs into the Fractality ecosystem.

---

## Interface Categories

### 1. Magnetoencephalography (MEG)
- Measures magnetic fields from neuronal activity
- High spatial resolution
- Bulky, lab-based — but miniaturization is underway

### 2. Functional Ultrasound (fUS)
- Tracks blood flow related to brain activity
- Promising for real-time deep brain access
- Experimental wearable versions emerging

### 3. Near-Infrared Spectroscopy (fNIRS)
- Light-based detection of blood oxygenation
- More portable than fMRI, useful for emotional states
- Can be paired with EEG for dual-input streams

### 4. Transcranial Magnetic/Ultrasound Stimulation
- Stimulus-based interfaces (feedback or state-shifting)
- Could be used to enhance specific node resonance or cognitive loops

### 5. Quantum Brain Interfaces (Theoretical)
- Explore potential for consciousness entanglement or coherence fields
- Symbolic quantum imprint → collapse into node manifestation
- Needs narrative scaffolding + theoretical metaphysics

## Potential Fractality Applications

- Deep state monitoring (theta/delta + fUS)
- Quantum node activation (mythic/convergent events)
- Emotional resonance overlays (fNIRS + HRV + EDA)
- Transcranial stimulation to reinforce symbolic integration

---

## Risks & Constraints

- High complexity and cost
- Ethical ambiguity (deep mind access)
- Lack of consumer-grade tools — roadmap toward future versions

---

## Path Forward

- Monitor miniaturization of MEG/fUS devices
- Prototype hybrid EEG + fNIRS + EDA systems
- Develop Fractality Symbol-to-Stimulation framework
