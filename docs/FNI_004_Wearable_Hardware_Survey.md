## Suggested Stack

1. **Short-Term Dev**: Muse S â†’ Fractality Passive Mapping
2. **Mid-Term Prototype**: OpenBCI â†’ Signal-to-Node JSON bridge
3. **Long-Term Platform**: OpenBCI + BioSignals â†’ Symbolic AI Agent

## Additional Notes

- All devices should stream data into a Fractality-compatible receiver (Python/Node).
- Protocol wrappers will be added for each device as we develop the Fractality Brain Interface Layer (FBIP).
- Modular upgrade paths: Combine EEG with EMG, EDA, HRV, eye-tracking for future versions.
